## FAQ

### Why this list?

Mobile gaming is unfortunately famous for abusing anti-consumer practices such as timegating, lootboxes, gacha mechanics and encouranging gambling amongst others. This list tries to provide a safe set of games by listing games that were originally designed for other gaming platforms (PC, consoles) where these mechanics are not as widely accepted. This list does not guarantee the quality of the listed games, only that they are also PC/Console games and thus they probably don't have predatory mechanics.

### Why not also add good games that are not ports?

That would require manual review of each game, something I don't have the time (and money) for.

### How to add a game to the list?

I followed the simple criteria below to create this list:

* The game must also be present in the PS Store, the Xbox store or any of the popular PC stores (Steam, GOG, Epic, etc)
* The must obviously not have any of the aforementioned anti-consumer practices

If you find a game not listed here that you'd like to add, please reach out to me or make a pull request and I'll add it as soon as possible.

### How does this list work?

Using the power of GitHub actions, the list is updated every day to refresh average review scores and prices. A list of App Store application IDs is kept in the `ids.tsv` file, which is then converted into table entries of this repo's `README.md` file by the `main.py` script and some Jinja2 magic.

### Why is the list not divided into categories?

Data for each application is retrieved from the iTunes Store API. Unfortunately the API does not provide much information and it's hard to get proper data such as game categories for each app, so it's hard to programmatically do it. If you are aware of a better way of achieving this, please reach out to me.
